## Automation Integration

### Trigger-Based Generation
**Major Feature Completion:**
```javascript
// Automatic post draft when major feature ships
if (isMajorFeature && passesQualityChecks) {
  generatePost('technical-deep-dive', featureAnalysis);
}
```

**Learning Moment Detection:**
```javascript
// Detect significant learning experiences
if (timeSpent > 4hours && involvedArchitectureDecision) {
  generatePost('learning-journey', challengeAnalysis);
}
```

### Content Pipeline
1. **Detection:** Automated analysis of recent work
2. **Draft Generation:** AI-powered first draft using templates
3. **Human Review:** Technical accuracy and narrative flow
4. **Polish:** SEO optimization and visual enhancements
5. **Scheduling:** Optimal publish timing
6. **Distribution:** Multi-platform publishing
