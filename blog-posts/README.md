Turn your coding journey into a content engine that builds authority, helps other developers, and creates marketing assets. This system analyzes your recent work and generates ready-to-publish blog post drafts.

## 🎯 What This System Does

- **🔍 Analyzes Git Commits**: Automatically detects what features you've built
- **📝 Generates Content**: Creates technical deep dives and learning journey posts
- **🎨 Uses Templates**: Professional templates with consistent branding
- **📊 Tracks Metrics**: Understands complexity and categorizes work
- **⚡ Workflow Integration**: Part of your development process

## 📁 Directory Structure

```
blog-posts/
├── templates/
│   ├── technical-deep-dive.md    # In-depth technical posts
│   └── learning-journey.md       # Authentic development stories
├── drafts/                       # Generated post drafts
├── published/                    # Final published posts

    ├── content-strategy.md      # Content planning & strategy
    └── README.md                # This file
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Generate Your First Blog Post

```bash
# From project root
cd blog-posts/_automation

# Generate a technical deep dive about recent work
node generate-post.js technical-deep-dive HEAD~10..HEAD

# Generate a learning journey story
node generate-post.js learning-journey HEAD~5..HEAD

# Use different commit ranges
node generate-post.js technical-deep-dive --since="2 weeks ago"
```

### What Happens

1. **Analysis**: Script analyzes git commits for patterns
2. **Categorization**: Detects work categories (memory, UI, AI, docs)
3. **Content Generation**: Fills templates with dynamic content
4. **Draft Creation**: Saves complete post to `drafts/` folder

## 📝 Post Types

### Technical Deep Dive
- **Audience**: Senior developers, architects
- **Use Case**: Complex features, architectural changes
- **Content**: Diagrams, code examples, performance metrics
- **Example**: Our memory system implementation

### Learning Journey
- **Audience**: Mid-level developers, career switchers
- **Use Case**: Mistakes made, lessons learned, insights
- **Content**: Personal stories, before/after comparisons
- **Example**: How we initially over-engineered a feature

## 🎨 Customization

### Update Templates

Templates use `{{VARIABLE_NAME}}` syntax. Edit `templates/*.md` to:
- Change tone and voice
- Add your branding
- Include custom sections
- Modify social links

### Modify Content Logic

Edit `generate-post.js` to customize:
- **Categories**: Add new work pattern detection
- **Titles**: Change auto-generated titles
- **Tags**: Modify tag generation logic
- **Estimates**: Adjust reading time calculations

### Configure Output

Update the generator script for:
- **Code Examples**: Include real code snippets
- **Links**: Update GitHub repository URLs
- **Social Links**: Personal Twitter/LinkedIn profiles
- **Series Names**: Customize content series

## 📊 Analytics & Insights

The system provides insights about your work:

```javascript
// Generated post analysis
{
  "commitsAnalyzed": 10,
  "filesChanged": 49,
  "primaryCategory": "memory",
  "complexity": "high",
  "readingTime": 17
}
```

Use this to understand:
- **Work Patterns**: What categories you work on most
- **Complexity Trends**: How technical your projects are
- **Content Volume**: How much writeable material you create

## 🔄 Workflow Integration

### Development Workflow

1. **Complete Feature**: Finish a significant piece of work
2. **Commit Changes**: Create meaningful commit messages
3. **Generate Post**: Run `node generate-post.js technical-deep-dive`
4. **Review & Edit**: Add personal touches and insights
5. **Publish**: Share with the community

### Automated Triggers

Set up git hooks or CI/CD to automatically generate posts:

```bash
# .git/hooks/post-commit
#!/bin/bash
cd blog-posts/_automation
node generate-post.js technical-deep-dive HEAD~5..HEAD
```

```

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Template not found"**
- Ensure template files exist in `templates/` directory
- Check file permissions and naming

**"Git repository not found"**
- Run from project root directory
- Verify you're in a git repository

**"No commits found"**
- Expand commit range (HEAD~20..HEAD)
- Check if repository has commits

### Generated Content Issues

**"Template variables not replaced"**
- Check variable syntax in templates (`{{VARIABLE}}`)
- Verify variable names match generator output

**"Categories detected incorrectly"**
- Update category keywords in `analyzeWork()` method
- Add commit message patterns for better detection
